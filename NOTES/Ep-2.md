# igniting the app

* to make app production ready you need to optimise the app for production
* package.json is configuration file for NPM
* what is a bundler? minifies the code or optimises eg: webpack , parcel , vite
* there are two type of dependies 
1> for development : dev dependies
2> build dependies : for production 
* difference between ^ and ~ :
    ^ : caret for minor aut updates
    ~ : tilde for major updates
* package-locks.json keep **tracks** of exact of exact version and dependies    
* transitive dependies : when a dependency depends upon other dependies/libraries
* .gitignore : a file that contains dependenties taht should be ignored to reduce app rededuncy
